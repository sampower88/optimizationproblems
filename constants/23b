# Tight alternating knot constant

## Description of constant
For a knot (or link) that can be represented as a diagram with a minimum of $C$ crossings, the ropelength is the infimum over all embeddings of the knot (or link) of the ratio of the contour length of the knot to its thickness. The thickness is defined as the radius of the smallest circle that passes through any three points on the knot (where colinear points yield an infinite radius). Colloquially, the ropelength is the least amount of rope required to tie a specific knot in a rope of unit radius. See Cantarella 2002 for full definition.

It was proven by Diao (2024) that knots that admit an alternating diagram have a ropelength that is at least linear and there exists a constant $b_o$ such that $L\geq b_{o}C$ for any alternating knot. 

Note that there is also a convention where the ropelength is defined relative to a unit-diameter rope, but unit-radius is more common.


## Known upper bounds
Upper bounds are typically found by constructing alternating torus knots or links and minimizing the parameters of their construction.

| Bound | Reference | Comments |
| ----- | --------- | -------- |
| 8.50| Olsen 2013 | Double helix |
| 7.63| Huh 2018 | Four-strand superhelix |
| $1+\pi\sqrt{4+\frac{1}{\pi^2}}\approx 7.36$| Klotz 2021 | Wrapped circle |
| 7.31|  Kim 2024 | Asymmetric double helix |


## Known lower bounds

| Bound | Reference | Comments |
| ----- | --------- | -------- |
|$\frac{1}/{59.5}$\approx 0.017 | Diao 2024 | Proved to exist.

## Additional comments
Non-alternating knots have a three-quarter power lower bound, discussed in 23a.
