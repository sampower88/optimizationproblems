# Gilbert-Pollak conjecture (Steiner ratio)

## Description of constant

$C_{42}$ is defined as the infimum of the ratio of the length of the Steiner Minimal Tree to the length of the Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree over all finite sets of points $V \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$: $C_{42} = \inf_{V}L_S(V)/L_M(V)$, where $L_S(V)$ and $L_M(V)$ denote the lengths of Steiner Minimal Tree and Minimum Spanning Tree, respectively.


Consider a set $V$ of $n$ points in the Euclidean plane $\mathbb{R}^2$. A spanning tree on $V$ is a connected, acyclic graph with vertex set $V$. When the length of each edge is defined as the Euclidean distance between its endpoints, a spanning tree that minimizes the total length is called a Minimum Spanning Tree. The shortest network interconnecting all points in $V$, where the length of each edge is measured by Euclidean distance, is necessarily a tree, referred to as a Steiner Minimal Tree. A Steiner Minimal Tree may contain auxiliary vertices not in $V$.

## Additional comments

* In 1968, Gilbert and Pollak conjectured that Steiner ratio is $\sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.866$, but this remains unproven. More information can be found at [Wikipedia page on the Gilbert-Pollak conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert%E2%80%93Pollak_conjecture).
